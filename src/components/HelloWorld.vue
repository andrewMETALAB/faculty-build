                                    Rather then telling others how to do things and complaining, we need to set an example: determine what needs to be done and help to get it done. This could be something as simple as "washing the dishes", setting a productive tone in meetings, or helping others to succeed. Our actions always say more about who we are than do our words!

There is nothing wrong with some free expression to relieve some stress -- but over venting can be detrimental. Moreover, we need to make sure each of us knows when the other is venting. Once you relieved the stress, its time to figure out the best way to move forward in a productive way.

                                We often find ourselves in a position where our plans need to change. These course corrections are often introduced by factors outside of our control. So as we plan, we must take steps to ensure that these plans are resilient. As necessary, we need to re-examine the original plan and adjust as quickly as possible to address the new situation. (I often hear quoted that its is not the strongest that survive but those that have the ability to adapt.)

We should, however, never fail to execute because we are waiting on input. Once you have provided sufficient time for others to provide feedback, you should use your best professional judgement to move forward.<br><br>

                        If you are waiting on my input, you should also proceed with your best judgement. You should "presume" you have my tacit approval. If I turns out that I am unhappy with the decision, the onus of the problem is mine -- for I am the one that should have been more timely in my feedback. We will learn from experience and move forward.

                                Many of times, some event will occur and we will want to react or we are expected to react. In this situation, the watchword is patience. Listen to what is being stated, but extract the underlying meaning of what is intended to be conveyed. (Remember the quote "It is not what I say, it is what I mean.") <br><br>

                        Once you have time to formulate an appropriate action plan... ACT!
